im trying to code a tic tac toe from scratch and I did the printboard and then needed the help of ai for the js syntax at the end and for the testing and github actions

# documentation 
- 1 dimentional array
  - instead of using a matrix board[][] i used board [] and initalized it with "[ ]"
- the checkWinner function is made via JS syntactic sugar ofcourse. Instead of the traditional looping throught the array and checking, just use the method in JS directly to do that and just declare the winning state prior and let the looping check that.
